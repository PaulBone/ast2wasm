-- it's useful.

-- We can't return multiple values or even tuple multiple values, so just

public quad a b c = let b24acsq = sqrt((b*b) - (4 * a * c)) in let ans1 = ((0-1 * b) + b24acsq) / (2*a) in let ans2 = ((0-1 * b) - b24acsq) / (2*a) in ans1

-- This also doesn't work because sqrt isn't supported.
sqrt x = x
