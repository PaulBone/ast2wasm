I'm experimenting with WebAssembly, an intermediate code representation for
the web (and elsewhere).  So I'm writing a code generator that targets it.

I used these resources:

* [Web Assembly website](http://webassembly.org)
* [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) Mostly
  JavaScript API for loading modules.
* [Wasm Assembler](https://github.com/webassembly/wabt)

While researching this I also found, but didn't use:

* [wasm Haskell package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wasm)
